                                    <li> 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                                        <li> 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                                            <li> 5 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
                                                <li> 1 yellow onion, quartered</li>
                                                    <li> ¼ cup lime juice</li>
                                                        <li> ¼ cup chicken broth</li>
                                                            <li> ½ bunch cilantro</li>
                                                                <li>1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, or more to taste</li>
                                                                    <li>1 orange, zested and juiced</li>
                                                                        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle over chicken breasts on both sides.</li>
                         <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and sear chicken breasts, 1 to 2 minutes per side, working in batches so chicken sears rather than steams. Transfer chicken to a plate.</li>
                            <li>Add garlic and onion to the hot cooker; cook and stir until browned evenly on all sides, about 2 minutes. Return chicken to the pressure cooker along with lime juice, chicken broth, cilantro, chipotle pepper with 1 tablespoon adobo sauce, orange zest and juice, and bay leaf. Close and lock the lid. Set timer for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on size of chicken breasts.</li>
                                 <li>Meanwhile, combine mayonnaise, milk, chipotle pepper and 1 tablespoon adobo sauce, salt, and garlic powder to an electric blender. Blend chipotle sauce until smooth.</li>
                                     <li>Release pressure from the cooker using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</li>
                                         <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
                                            <li>Transfer chicken breasts to a clean surface and reserve cooking liquid. Shred chicken meat using 2 forks. Place in a large bowl and drizzle 1/4 cup cooking liquid over chicken; toss to coat. Drizzle 1 tablespoon oil over the surface of a baking sheet. Add chicken to the sheet and drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon oil on top. Stir to coat evenly.</li> 
                                              <li>Broil chicken in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Toss chicken with 1 to 2 tablespoons reserved cooking liquid and rotate the pan for even broiling. Continue broiling until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes more. Serve with chipotle sauce.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>You can use chicken thighs instead of breasts, if you'd like.</p>
